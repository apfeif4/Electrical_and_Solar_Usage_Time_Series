# ⚡ Electrical & Solar Energy Usage – Time Series Forecasting

## 📝 Overview

This project builds **time series forecasting models** for solar and non-solar energy usage in **Mesa, Arizona** using **XGBoost**, **Elastic Net**, and **Facebook Prophet**.
The goal is to help a solar company evaluate market potential by predicting future energy consumption trends and comparing solar vs. non-solar usage patterns.

**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 🎯 Objective

A solar company is considering establishing operations in Mesa, Arizona, due to rising electricity prices.
They want data-driven insights to present to stakeholders and customers, focusing on:

1. Is overall **energy usage** expected to increase?
2. How is **solar-powered property usage** changing over time?
3. Are there **seasonal patterns**, such as higher consumption in summer?
4. Are there notable **winter spikes** in energy usage?
5. Which model provides the **most accurate energy consumption forecast**?
